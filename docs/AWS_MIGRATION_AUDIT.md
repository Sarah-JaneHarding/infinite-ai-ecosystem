## AWS Services Required

### Compute

| Service | Purpose | Cost model |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **ECS Fargate** | apps/web, apps/worker, apps/gateway, Keycloak, Langfuse web/worker | Shared baseline |
| **EC2 t4g.large** | ClickHouse (Langfuse analytics — cannot Fargate-ize) | Shared baseline |
| **Application Auto Scaling** | Scale Fargate on CPU/memory; critical for school-day peak 07:00–15:00 SAST | Free |

### Database

| Service | Purpose | Config |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **RDS PostgreSQL 16** | App DB: tenants, consent ledger, Brain, audit_event. pgvector, pg_trgm, pgcrypto | Multi-AZ, db.t4g.medium → r6g.large at Growth |
| **RDS PostgreSQL (Langfuse)** | Langfuse internal DB — separated by design | db.t4g.small, Multi-AZ |
| **ElastiCache Redis 7** | BullMQ queues, rate limiting, idempotency keys. Two clusters: app + Langfuse | cache.t4g.small, Multi-AZ |

### Storage

| Service | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **S3 (af-south-1)** | Brain snapshots, artefacts, uploads, exports. Replaces MinIO in dev | SSE-KMS required (POPIA) |
| **EBS gp3** | ClickHouse data volumes | 200 GB pilot → 2 TB scale |
| **ECR** | Docker images — immutable tags (commit SHA), 20-image lifecycle | Scan on push |

### Networking

| Service | Purpose | Cost note |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **VPC** | Private/public subnets, 2 AZs. Flow logs enabled | Required |
| **ALB** | HTTPS termination, WAF attachment point, path-based routing | ~$25/month |
| **NAT Gateway ×2** | Outbound internet for private subnets (one per AZ for HA) | ~$100/month fixed |
| **Route 53** | DNS for SaaS domain + school subdomains | $0.50/zone/month |
| **CloudFront** | CDN for Next.js static assets | Reduces ALB load |
| **VPC Endpoints** | S3 gateway (free) + Secrets Manager/ECR interface endpoints | Reduces NAT cost |

### Security & Identity

| Service | Purpose | Obligation |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **WAF** | OWASP top-10, rate limiting, SQLi/XSS rules on ALB | POPIA / STRIDE |
| **Shield Standard** | DDoS protection on ALB and CloudFront | Free, mandatory |
| **Secrets Manager** | All credentials. RDS master password auto-rotated | Rule 7 of 11 |
| **ACM** | TLS certificates for ALB and CloudFront | Free |
| **KMS** | Encryption CMKs for RDS, S3, Secrets Manager | POPIA |
| **IAM** | ECS task roles + GitHub OIDC federation. No long-lived access keys | Required |
| **GuardDuty** | Threat detection on CloudTrail / VPC flow logs / DNS | Required for children's data |

### Observability

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **CloudWatch** | Container logs (all services), metrics, alarms, dashboards |
| **CloudTrail** | AWS API audit log. Mandatory for POPIA compliance trail |
| **AWS Config** | Encryption-at-rest and public-S3 compliance rules (defer to Growth tier) |

> LLM observability (traces, datasets, evals) is handled by self-hosted **Langfuse** via OTel OTLP. CloudWatch is for infrastructure only.

### CI/CD

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **S3 + DynamoDB** | Terraform state backend (one per environment) |
| **IAM OIDC Provider** | GitHub Actions token exchange. STS short-lived credentials, no stored keys |

### Email & Messaging

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **SES** | Invoices, guardian comms, budget alerts |
| **SNS** | GuardDuty → on-call; CloudWatch alarms → on-call |

### Business Operations

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Cost Explorer + Budgets** | Tag-based cost allocation; 80% / 100% spend alerts |
| **AWS Backup** | Automated RDS (14-day), ElastiCache, and EBS backups |
| **AWS Support — Business** | 24/7 support, Trusted Advisor, Health Dashboard |
| **AWS Organizations** | Multi-account isolation (prod / staging / dev). SCPs for POPIA controls |

## Per-School Economics & Gross Margin

### Subscription tiers (ex VAT)

| Tier | Learner cap | Price / month | Annual / school |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Starter | ≤150 | R1,200 | R14,400 |
| Professional | ≤500 | R3,500 | R42,000 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | R8,500 | R102,000 |

VAT (15%) adds R180 / R525 / R1,275 per month respectively.

### Gross margin by scale

Mix assumption: 50% Professional, 35% Starter, 15% Enterprise.

| Scale | Monthly revenue | Monthly COGS | Gross profit | Gross margin |
|-------|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Pilot (5 schools) | R17,225 | R32,687 | –R15,462 | –90% |
| Startup (25 schools) | R86,125 | R56,880 | R29,245 | 34% |
| Growth (100 schools) | R344,500 | R161,123 | R183,377 | 53% |
| Scale (500 schools) | R1,722,500 | R654,018 | R1,068,482 | 62% |

**Break-even:** approximately 12 schools on Professional tier only, or 16 schools at the realistic mixed tier.

> The pilot is intentionally loss-making. The shared baseline (Multi-AZ RDS, dual NAT Gateways, Langfuse stack) is sized for 25+ schools. Pilot objective is product-market fit, not margin.

## Migration Steps (Dev → AWS)

1. **AWS Organizations setup** — create three member accounts (dev, staging, production). Apply SCPs: deny non-af-south-1 resources, deny public S3 ACLs.
2. **Terraform state bootstrap** — manually create S3 bucket + DynamoDB table per account for remote state.
3. **GitHub OIDC federation** — `terraform apply` to register the IAM OIDC provider and deploy role.
4. **Full `terraform apply` — production** — VPC, RDS, ElastiCache, ECS cluster, ALB, ECR, Secrets Manager, KMS, CloudTrail, GuardDuty. ~15 minutes.
5. **Bootstrap DB roles** — run `./bootstrap-roles.sh production` via VPN. Reads passwords from Secrets Manager, never writes to disk.
6. **Prisma migrations** — CI runs `db:migrate:deploy` with the `migrator` role. Seed curriculum data.
7. **Build + push images** — GitHub Actions builds and pushes to ECR with immutable commit-SHA tags.
8. **Deploy ECS services** — rolling deployment, 100% minimum healthy, 120s grace period.
9. **Provision Keycloak** — `--import-realm` from infra/keycloak/realm.json.
10. **First school tenant** — run provisioning job, validate with `pnpm test:rls:exhaustive` against live DB.
11. **Load test** — `pnpm load:peak` from af-south-1. Target: P99 < 2s page load, P99 < 8s artefact generation.

## POPIA Compliance — AWS Controls

| Obligation | AWS control | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Data residency | Provider locked to af-south-1; SCP denies other regions | ✅ Implemented |
| Encryption at rest | RDS SSE-KMS, S3 SSE-KMS, EBS KMS | ✅ Implemented |
| Encryption in transit | TLS 1.3 on ALB, RDS SSL required, Redis TLS | ✅ Implemented |
| Audit trail | CloudTrail (all API calls) + app audit_event ledger | ✅ Implemented |
| Least privilege | IAM task roles + 4 Postgres roles + RBAC | ✅ Implemented |
| Breach notification | GuardDuty → SNS + CloudTrail forensics | ⚠ Runbook needed |
| Retention & deletion | S3 lifecycle, RDS TTL, app tombstone path | ⚠ Per-school schedule needed |

---

## Priority Recommendations

1. **VPC Interface Endpoints immediately** — S3 gateway (free) + Secrets Manager/ECR endpoints (~$14/month each) reduce NAT Gateway charges from day one.
2. **Reserved Instances at month 2** — 1-year no-upfront for RDS and ElastiCache saves ~30%.
3. **Tag everything with `School` from day one** — feeds billing reconciliation and per-tenant cost attribution.
4. **Anthropic volume commitment at 50 schools** — ~R48K/month LLM spend warrants a discount conversation.
5. **ClickHouse cluster before 200 schools** — single-node has no HA; Langfuse traces are POPIA compliance evidence.
6. **School-hours auto-scaling** — scale in aggressively 18:00–06:00 SAST and weekends; saves ~20% on compute.
