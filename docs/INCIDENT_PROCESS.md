# Incident Process

On-call rotation, severity classification, and response procedures for INFINITE-AI.

## Severity levels

| Severity | Definition                                                  | Response time     | Examples                                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P1**   | Complete service unavailability or confirmed data breach    | 15 minutes        | Gateway down, RLS bypass detected, PII in logs          |
| **P2**   | Significant degradation for ≥ 1 tenant, or security concern | 1 hour            | Artefact generation failing for one school, auth errors |
| **P3**   | Minor degradation or cosmetic issue                         | Next business day | Slow page loads, UI glitch, non-critical bug            |
| **P4**   | Enhancement request or question                             | Within 1 week     | Feature feedback, documentation gaps                    |

## On-call rotation

**Minimum viable rotation:** 2 engineers. Each engineer is on-call for one week at a
time, rotating on Monday 08:00 SAST.

| Role              | Responsibility                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary on-call   | First responder for all P1/P2 alerts. Pages within 15 min for P1. |
| Secondary on-call | Backup if primary is unreachable within 15 minutes.               |

**OQ-019:** The actual rotation schedule is not populated until pilot engineers are
confirmed. The tooling (PagerDuty or equivalent) is blocked on OQ-014 (paging
integration).

### Alert routing

All alerts flow from the monitoring system → PagerDuty → on-call engineer's phone.
Safeguarding escalations skip PagerDuty and page immediately (OQ-014).

## Incident response procedure

### P1 — 15 minute SLA

1. **Acknowledge** the alert in PagerDuty.
2. **Assess**: confirm the nature of the incident. Check the runbooks in `docs/RUNBOOKS/`.
3. **Communicate**: post to the `#incidents` channel:
   ```
   [P1 INCIDENT OPEN] <short description>
   Impact: <who is affected>
   Current status: Investigating
   Next update: <15 min>
   ```
4. **Mitigate**: apply the relevant runbook. Rollback if a recent deploy is the cause
   (see `RUNBOOKS/canary-deploy.md`).
5. **Escalate** to security lead if PII may have been exposed (within 30 minutes).
6. **Resolve**: confirm resolution, post to `#incidents`.
7. **Post-mortem**: within 48 hours. See post-mortem template below.

### P2 — 1 hour SLA

Same flow as P1 but with a 1-hour initial response and 4-hour resolution target.
Communication is in `#incidents` but does not require a 15-minute update cadence.

### P3 / P4

Log as a GitHub issue with the appropriate severity label. No on-call escalation.

## Data breach response (POPIA §22)

If personal information of learners, educators, or staff may have been compromised:

1. **Immediately** page the security lead (do not wait for normal on-call response).
2. Preserve evidence: do not modify logs or rotate secrets without guidance.
3. **Within 72 hours**: notify the Information Regulator (POPIA §22(1)).
4. **Notify affected data subjects** as soon as reasonably practicable.
5. Open a confidential incident record in `docs/RUNBOOKS/` (not a public GitHub issue).
6. Engage legal counsel.

## Runbooks

| Scenario                       | Runbook                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Canary deploy and rollback     | `docs/RUNBOOKS/canary-deploy.md`     |
| Gateway latency spike          | `docs/RUNBOOKS/gateway-latency.md`   |
| Database restore (DR)          | `docs/RUNBOOKS/db-restore.md`        |
| RLS isolation breach           | `docs/RUNBOOKS/rls-breach.md`        |
| PII in logs                    | `docs/RUNBOOKS/pii-in-logs.md`       |
| Safeguarding escalation        | `docs/RUNBOOKS/safeguarding.md`      |
| POPIA data-subject request     | `docs/RUNBOOKS/popia-dsr.md`         |
| Billing reconciliation failure | `docs/RUNBOOKS/billing-reconcile.md` |

Runbooks are validated in CI by `pnpm drill:restore`, which checks that each runbook
file exists and declares an `RTO` and `RPO` in its header.
