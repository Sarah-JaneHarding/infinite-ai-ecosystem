# Pilot Protocol

This document defines the success metrics, weekly review cadence, and escalation path
for the INFINITE-AI pilot programme.

**OQ-019 resolved 2026-09-09.** Benjamin Pine Primary School is confirmed as pilot
school #1. See the confirmed cohort table below. Schools #2 and #3 are still to be
identified before the full cohort target of three is met.

## Pilot cohort

Target: 3 schools in the first pilot cohort. Pilot start: **Term 4 2026 (2026-10-06).**

| #   | School                       | Profile                                  | Tier         | LoLT | Implementation partner        | Status                   |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1   | Benjamin Pine Primary School | Small primary, Grades R–7, Afrikaans FAL | Starter      | en   | mrsharding@benjaminpine.co.za | **Confirmed 2026-09-09** |
| 2   | _(to be identified)_         | Large primary (≈ 500 learners)           | Professional | —    | —                             | Pending                  |
| 3   | _(to be identified)_         | School group (≥ 2 campuses)              | Enterprise   | —    | —                             | Pending                  |

Each pilot school is assigned an implementation partner contact and an on-call engineer.
Tenant provisioning for confirmed schools uses `packages/provisioning`'s `PILOT_COHORT`
configuration as the onboarding wizard's starting defaults.

## Weekly review cadence

### Participants

- Implementation partner lead (school side)
- Platform product owner
- On-call engineer
- (Week 8+) Billing lead

### Agenda (30 minutes)

1. **Usage metrics** (5 min): artefacts generated, active users, any anomalies.
2. **Issues logged** (5 min): any bugs, confusing UI, missing features.
3. **Educator feedback** (10 min): qualitative feedback from the implementation partner.
4. **Technical health** (5 min): SLO status, any incidents since last review.
5. **Next steps** (5 min): actions from this review, owner, due date.

### Artefacts produced per review

- Brief written summary (shared in the implementation partner's Slack/email).
- Any issues logged in `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` if they require a design decision.
- Bug reports filed as GitHub issues with `pilot` label.

## Escalation path

| Situation                            | Action                                           | Owner            | SLA                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Educator cannot log in               | Check auth provider, reset session               | On-call engineer | 2 hours                |
| Artefact generation fails repeatedly | Diagnose via gateway logs; check budget          | On-call engineer | 4 hours                |
| PII observed in a log or artefact    | Security incident — see `INCIDENT_PROCESS.md`    | Security lead    | Immediate              |
| POPIA data-subject request received  | Follow POPIA DSR process                         | Operations team  | 30 days (statutory)    |
| School wants to withdraw from pilot  | Discuss with product owner; begin offboarding    | Product owner    | Within 5 business days |
| SLO breach (P1)                      | Page on-call, open incident, notify pilot school | On-call engineer | 15 minutes             |

---

## Pilot offboarding

If a school exits the pilot before completion:

1. Notify the operations team.
2. Set tenant status to SUSPENDED (billing pauses).
3. Export any school-owned data the school requests (data portability — POPIA §18).
4. After 30 days with no objection, mark tenant CLOSED and erase mutable data.
5. Retain audit and consent ledgers as per legal obligation (OQ-022).

## Go/no-go decision (end of pilot)

A go/no-go meeting is held at week 16 with the following decision criteria:

| Criterion             | Go                       | No-go                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Schools renewing      | ≥ 2 of 3                 | 0 of 3                  |
| P1 security incidents | 0                        | Any                     |
| POPIA compliance gaps | None                     | Any unresolved          |
| Model cost at scale   | Within 130 % of estimate | > 200 % (unsustainable) |
| Educator NPS          | ≥ 30                     | < 10                    |

A "no-go" result requires a documented plan to address blockers before re-piloting.
Open questions blocking go-live are logged in `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.
