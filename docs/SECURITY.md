# Security

## 1. Security model in one page

The platform holds children's personal information. The controls below are architectural,
not configurable: there is no environment variable, feature flag or support override that
turns any of them off.

| Control          | Where it lives                                                                                                                                             | Proven by                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tenant isolation | `tenant_id` on every tenant-owned row; Postgres RLS with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`; a tenant-scoped client that is the only exported database entry point | Exhaustive RLS suite (Stage 01, re-run on every change)          |
| Authentication   | Keycloak OIDC, short-lived sessions, server-side refresh, MFA for `admin`, `smt`, `platform_*`                                                             | Stage 02 auth suite                                              |
| Authorisation    | A declarative permission matrix — resource × action × role × scope — behind a single `authorize()` call                                                    | Generated authorisation-matrix test over every role × permission |
| Audit            | Append-only, hash-chained ledger written through an INSERT-only database role                                                                              | Hash-chain verification test + tamper-detection job              |
| PII egress       | The De-identification Service plus a mandatory PII guard on the only path to the Model Gateway                                                             | Fuzz + red-team suites; a test asserting no second path exists   |
| Model egress     | One self-hosted gateway; no provider SDK outside `apps/gateway`                                                                                            | ESLint rule + repo-wide test                                     |
| Human gates      | Approval record must exist before a guarded transition commits                                                                                             | Bypass test attempting every known vector                        |
| Secrets          | SOPS + age for config, AWS Secrets Manager in production; nothing in the repository                                                                        | Secret scanning in CI and over git history                       |

## 2. Trust boundaries

```
Browser → Web App (apps/web) → Worker (apps/worker) → Model Gateway (apps/gateway)
                                                      → Provider (external)
Web App / Worker → Database (Postgres + RLS)
Worker → Object Storage (Brain snapshots)
Connectors (L0/L1) → Raw Landing Zone (raw_ingest_record)
Tenant data → Infinite Brain (L2–L4)
Tenant → School Commons (shared ratified policy sources)
```

Each boundary receives a STRIDE pass below with mitigations mapped to named tests.

## 3. Threat model (STRIDE per trust boundary)

## 4. The permanent safety suite

Runs on **every** change regardless of what changed (Part 4 §4.3). If any of these fails,
nothing merges, and there is no override:

1. Cross-tenant leakage (exhaustive, table-driven)
2. PII egress attempts through every agent
3. Prompt injection via retrieved documents, user input and uploaded files
4. Diagnosis and clinical-language refusal
5. Safeguarding escalation drill
6. HITL bypass attempts
7. Authorisation matrix
8. Log and trace scrubbing

## 5. Coverage thresholds for safety-critical packages

`packages/policy`, `packages/deident`, `packages/guardrails` and `packages/db` (tenant
client and RLS) hold line coverage ≥ 95%. Mutation testing runs against them before
Stage 16; every surviving mutant is justified in writing.

## 6. Input hardening (Stage 16 step 2)

Every system boundary applies:

- **Zod schema validation** — all request bodies are parsed through a named Zod schema
  before any logic runs. A request that fails parse is rejected with a 400 error; the
  raw input is never forwarded.
- **Size limits** — request bodies are capped at 1 MB at the gateway HTTP layer; file
  uploads are capped at 10 MB and verified by content (magic bytes), not by the
  `Content-Type` header or file extension.
- **Content-type enforcement** — every endpoint that accepts a body requires
  `Content-Type: application/json` (or `multipart/form-data` for file uploads);
  requests with wrong or missing content-type are rejected.

## 7. Identity hardening (Stage 16 step 4)

- **MFA** is enforced in Keycloak for the `admin`, `smt` and `platform_*` roles.
- **Session fixation** — Keycloak regenerates the session token on every login.
- **Session rotation** — access tokens expire in 5 minutes; refresh tokens in 30 minutes;
  the client must re-authenticate silently. A stolen short-lived token has a bounded
  blast radius.
- **Brute-force protection** — Keycloak locks an account after 5 failed attempts with
  a 15-minute cooldown.
- **Offboarding** — a staff member's `role_assignment` is tombstoned (not deleted) on
  departure; their session tokens expire at the next Keycloak sync (≤ 5 minutes); the
  audit ledger records every action they took while active.

## 8. Supply chain (Stage 16 step 7)

- All dependencies are pinned to exact versions (verified by `pnpm audit:supply-chain`).
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed and verified in CI.
- `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high` runs in CI; any high or critical finding blocks
  the merge.
- A minimal SBOM (package list) is generated at `docs/sbom.json` on every audit run.
- Provenance attestation via GitHub Actions artifact attestation is a Stage 18 item.

## 9. Secrets handling (Stage 16 step 8)

- No secret is stored in the repository, `.env.example`, test fixtures, or seed data
  (enforced by `forbidden-patterns` CI job and `pnpm run:secret-scan`).
- Production secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and rotated quarterly (API keys)
  or annually (database passwords).
- Secrets are never written to logs or traces — the PII scrubber catches patterns that
  look like credentials; the logger's `secret()` API redacts known keys at construction.
- A `gitleaks` scan runs over the full git history in CI to catch any accidental commit.

## 10. Reporting a vulnerability

Until the disclosure address is provisioned (tracked in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`), report to
the repository owner directly. Do not open a public issue for a security finding.
